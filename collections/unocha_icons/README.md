The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian affairs (OCHA) has created a set of 500 freely available humanitarian icons to help relief workers present emergency and crisis-related information quickly and simply.

[MapAction](http://mapaction.org/) took the icons and built some amazing styles for [QGIS](http://mapaction.org/resources/gis-resources.html).
